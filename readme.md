The idea is to make games for kids who are just being exposed to computers for the first time.

For Charlotte, that was today: Sunday, 3 December 2023. She is a little over 2 years old.

I want to make games that Charlotte could play to learn how to use a computer. Things like moving the mouse, typing, and navigating using the arrow keys.
